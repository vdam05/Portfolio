# Projects
Built projects such as portfolio, games and others for resume

   ## Portfolio
   HTML files, CSS files and ~~JavaScripts~~ for interactions. Also links to personal projects (could?)

   ## Game 
   Java: Perhaps a utility software <br/>
   Perhaps using Java's Swing to make an app <br/>
   C, C#, or C++: Perhaps a game (due to higher performance) like <br/>
   Maybe even Python??? <br/>
