# Projects (Updated 5/8/24)
Built projects such as portfolio, games and others for resume

   ## Portfolio
   HTML files, CSS files and JavaScripts for interactions. Also links to personal projects.
   Update: The portfolio is quite complete in responsiveness and content. Can add more overtime when needed.

   ## Other projects 
   Java: A Java 2d turn-based game that is pixel-like and simpler on the graphic to sustain performance <br/>
   C, C#, or C++: Perhaps something that requires high performance <br/>
   JavaScript: A website that comprises of a lot of things for learning like a Pomodoro watch, a random music generator (using API?), flashcards and others <br/>
